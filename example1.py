"""
Functions can have some default values in input parameters.  When a default value is specified,
it does not have to be included in the program.  To specify a default value, you use the following
notation in your function definition:
"""

def multiply(x=2):
  # this function multiples the input parameter x by 5.
  # by default, the value for x is 2
  # this function does not need to return a value, but we 
  # include a return None statement to show it has no output
    print(x*5)
    return None
    
    


multiply()
multiply(3)
multiply(4)
